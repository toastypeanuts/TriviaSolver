# Trivia Solver
Used a phone mirror program to mirror my iPhone to my pc.
From there I used a screenshotting tool that knew the exact dimensions of the screen to capture based on the phone being mirrored.
Used watchdog to watch a folder where the screenshot automatically went through and immediately ran OCR on it.
Parsed the questions and answers and ran it through a algorithm that scraped a google web search and calculated the answers based on a confidence level

Overall a really fun project to try to solve trivia questions on a super popular app.
Borderline impossible for me to get 100% accuracy without some kind of machine learning and/or natural language processing.
